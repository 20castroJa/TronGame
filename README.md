# TronGame
The original tron arcade game remade. The tron game is an arcade game later made into a movie. I have remade it with javascript.
How to play:
  Use arrow keys to switch directions (your bike will automatically move itself)
  Try to cut the computer off by making it run into your "trail"
  First person to run into the edge, other player's "trail", or their own trail, loses.
